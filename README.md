## Group 7 Visualization Proposal


#### An overview of the goals ###

We plan to develop a dashboard that explores the question:  What is the relationship between Police use of force and abandoned properties to reveal reasons why areas might have less housing?
Our visualization will involve 2 layers shown over the South Bend area:

1. Police Use of Force.

2. Abandoned property counts.

#### A rationale for the dashboard / user interface 

We plan to use leaflet inside RShiny to provide an interactive dashboard that allows users to remove layers.

#### An Audience analysis

Mayor Mueller is the chief executive of the City of South Bend. The city’s thirty-third mayor, he was sworn into office on January 1, 2020. As mayor, Mueller is responsible for the city workforce of over 1,000 employees and an annual budget over $380 million.

After attending St. Joseph’s High School, the University of Notre Dame, and the University of Delaware for his PhD, Mueller worked in public policy before returning home in 2015 to join the Buttigieg administration as Mayor Pete’s Chief of Staff, Mueller promoted pragmatic public policies and affordable energy solutions at the George Washington University’s Solar Institute in Washington, DC. He also served in the office of US Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), for nearly four years, first as a John A. Knauss Legislative Fellow and then as a policy adviser on energy and natural resources.

Mueller’s tenure as Chief of Staff included the establishment of the first Diversity and Inclusion Office in Indiana, as well as the creation of the Departments of Innovation & Technology and the Venues Parks and Arts Department.  Mueller went on to become the Executive Director of Community Investment where he was responsible for attracting businesses to South Bend and investing in the neighborhoods.  Early in his tenure as Executive Director of Community Investment, Mueller established the Engagement & Economic Empowerment Division to empower residents with access to economic opportunities and meaningful civic participation

The new elected mayor, James Mueller, was part of the Buttigieg administration as Mayor Pete’s Chief of Staff.  He was classmate with Buttigieg at St. Joseph High School, where he graduated in 2000.  He gained a bachelor’s degree from the University of Notre Dame, triple majoring in mathematics, history and philosophy.  His father, Thomas, was a professor of aerospace and mechanical engineering at the University of Notre Dame, and his mother, Sarah, was a teacher, homemaker and social service coordinator at the YMCA[1].  Mayor Mueller is very proud of the work done to decrease unemployment and resurge South Bend’s economy.  Furthermore, great strides have been made to the revitalization project of the downtown area.  Parks and recreation have also received many improvements, even an ice ring has been created.  Unfortunately, the west side of the city continuous to be a very troubled area and has fueling great political animosity toward the previous mayor.  Recurring mass shootings and underprivileged residents are pleading for a social economic revitalization that appears to be only occurring in the affluent areas of greater South Bend.  An astonishing amount of abandoned properties are present in the west side of South Bend.  Mueller’s priorities as mayor are:

* Strengthening education from cradle to career to set up every child for success
* Reforming our public safety systems to make us all safer
* Promoting shared growth and an economy that works for everyone
* Rebuilding our neighborhoods block by block[2].
